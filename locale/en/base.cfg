laserfence=Fend off biters using Laser Fence technology from the Command and Conquer universe that was developed during the Tiberium Wars.

[entity-name]
laserfence-post=Laser Fence Emitter
laserfence-beam=Laser Fence Section
laserfence-post-gate=Laser Fence Gate Emitter
laserfence-beam-gate=Laser Fence Gate Section

[entity-description]
laserfence-post=A Laser Fence generator that can maintain a 'fence' of max length __1__ between two emitters.\nEach emitter needs to fully charge before it will create a fence to aligned emitters and needs a constant power input of __2__kW plus __3__kW per segment to maintain the fences.\nWhen one fence segment is destroyed the entire fence dissipates and the emitters must recharge for the fence to re-form. 
laserfence-beam=A section of the fence that zaps attackers.\nWhen one fence segment is destroyed the entire fence dissipates and the emitters must recharge for the fence to reform. 
laserfence-post-gate=An alternate Laser Fence generator that can maintain a retractable 'gate' of max length __1__ between two gate emitters.\nWill form and ordinary 'fence' in directions connected to Laser Fence Emitters.\nEach emitter needs to fully charge before it will create a fence to aligned emitters and needs a constant power input of __2__kW plus __3__kW per segment to maintain the fences.\nWhen one fence segment is destroyed the entire fence dissipates and the emitters must recharge for the fence to re-form. 
laserfence-beam-gate=A section of the fence that zaps attackers.\nWhen the player approaches the gate, it will deactivate to let them through.\nWhen one fence segment is destroyed the entire fence dissipates and the emitters must recharge for the fence to reform. 
laserfence-obstruction-text=Laser Fence blocked by __1__

[mod-setting-description]
laserfence-template=__1__\nDefault: __2__
laserfence-debug-text=Whether to spam chat with debugging info and event notifications.
laserfence-solid-walls=Whether fence segments should have collision. Without collision it's less of a fence and more of a decoration.
laserfence-base-range=The maximum number of fence sections between two Laser Fence posts.
laserfence-added-range=The amount of additional fence senctions granted by the Laser Fence Connection Range upgrade.
laserfence-health=Laser Fence HP.
laserfence-base-damage=Amount of damage that biters take from attacking the Laser Fence.
laserfence-beam-weapon-scaling=Whether to have Laser Fence damage scaled by upgrades that apply to beam weapons.
laserfence-power=The number of kW required to power a single Laser Fence post. For reference, a vanilla Assembler 2 takes 150kW.
laserfence-segment-power=The number of kW required to power a single tile of Laser Fence. For reference, a vanilla Assembler 2 takes 150kW.
