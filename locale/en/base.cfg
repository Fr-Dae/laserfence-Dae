[mod-description]
laserfence=Use Laser Fence technology developed during the Tiberium Wars to fend off biters.

[entity-name]
laserfence-post=Laser Fence Emitter
laserfence-beam=Laser Fence Section

[entity-description]
laserfence-post=A Laser Fence generator that can maintain a 'fence' of max length __1__ between two emitters. Each emitter needs to fully charge before it will create a fence to aligned emitters and needs a constant 0.5MW of power to maintain the fences. When one fence segment is destroyed the entire fence dissipates and the emitters must recharge for the fence to reform. 
laserfence-beam=A section of the fence that zaps attackers. When one fence segment is destroyed the entire fence dissipates and the emitters must recharge for the fence to reform. 
laserfence-obstruction-text=Laser Fence blocked by __1__

laserfence=Laser Fence
laserfence-range=Laser Fence Connection Range

[technology-description]
laserfence=Laser Fences to keep the biters out
laserfence-range-effect=Increases the range at which Laser Fences can connect by __1__

laserfence-debug-text=Debug Text
laserfence-solid-walls=Solid Walls
laserfence-base-range=Base Length
laserfence-added-range=Length Upgrade
laserfence-health=Health
laserfence-base-damage=Damage
laserfence-beam-weapon-scaling=Scale Damage with Beam Weapon Upgrades?
laserfence-power=Power Consumption

laserfence-template=__1__\nDefault: __2__
laserfence-debug-text=Whether to spam chat with debugging info and event notifications.
laserfence-solid-walls=Whether fence segments should have collision. Without collision it's less of a fence and more of a decoration.
laserfence-base-range=The maximum number of fence sections between two Laser Fence posts.
laserfence-added-range=The amount of additional fence senctions granted by the Laser Fence Connection Range upgrade.
laserfence-health=Laser Fence HP.
laserfence-base-damage=Amount of damage that biters take from attacking the Laser Fence.
laserfence-beam-weapon-scaling=Whether to have Laser Fence damage scaled by upgrades that apply to beam weapons.
laserfence-power=The number of kW required to power a single Laser Fence post. Only the posts require power, not the fence segments. For reference, an Assembler 2 takes 150kW.
