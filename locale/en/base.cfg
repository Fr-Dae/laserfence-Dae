laserfence-post=Laser Fence Emitter
laserfence-beam=Laser Fence Section

[entity-description]
laserfence-post=A Laser Fence generator that can maintain a 'fence' of max length 15 between two emitters. Each emitter needs to fully charge before it will create a fence to aligned emitters and needs a constant 0.5MW of power to maintain the fences. When one fence segment is destroyed the entire fence dissipates and the emitters must recharge for the fence to reform. 
laserfence-beam=A section of the fence that zaps attackers. When one fence segment is destroyed the entire fence dissipates and the emitters must recharge for the fence to reform.

laserfence-solid-walls=What if you could walk through the laser beams? I guess they wouldn't be very effective walls then, but we did add this setting so you could turn off collision.\nDefault: on
