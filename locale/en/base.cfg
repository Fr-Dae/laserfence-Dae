laserfence=Laser Fence

[mod-description]
laserfence=Use Laser Fence technology developed during the Tiberium Wars to fend off biters.

[entity-name]
laserfence-post=Laser Fence Emitter
laserfence-beam=Laser Fence Section

[entity-description]
laserfence-post=A Laser Fence generator that can maintain a 'fence' of max length __1__ between two emitters. Each emitter needs to fully charge before it will create a fence to aligned emitters and needs a constant 0.5MW of power to maintain the fences. When one fence segment is destroyed the entire fence dissipates and the emitters must recharge for the fence to reform. 
laserfence-beam=A section of the fence that zaps attackers. When one fence segment is destroyed the entire fence dissipates and the emitters must recharge for the fence to reform. 
laserfence-obstruction-text=Laser Fence blocked by __1__

laserfence=Laser Fence
laserfence-range=Laser Fence Connection Range

[technology-description]
laserfence=Laser Fences to keep the biters out
laserfence-range-effect=Increases the range at which Laser Fences can connect by __1__

[mod-setting-description]
laserfence-debug-text=Only useful for debugging, spams chat with event notifications.\nDefault: off
laserfence-solid-walls=What if you could walk through the laser beams? I guess they wouldn't be very effective walls then, but we did add this setting so you could turn off collision.\nDefault: on
laserfence-base-range=The maximum number of fence sections between two Laser Fence posts.\nDefault: 12
laserfence-added-range=The amount of additional fence senctions granted by the Laser Fence Connection Range upgrade.\nDefault: 3
